Given a value N, find the number of ways to make change for N cents, if we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , SM } valued coins.

**Example 1:**
```java
Input:
n = 4 , m = 3
S[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 4
Explanation: Four Possible ways are:
{1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.
```
**Example 2:**
```java
Input:
n = 10 , m = 4
S[] ={2,5,3,6}
Output: 5
Explanation: Five Possible ways are:
{2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5}
and {5,5}.
