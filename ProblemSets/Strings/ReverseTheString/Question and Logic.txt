Question :

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Example 1:**

```
Input:["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output:["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

- Answer :
    1. Brute-force approach :
        - Take the input as a character array
        - As we reverse the array do it in the same manner
